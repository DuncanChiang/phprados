** PHPRADOS **
phprados is a PHP extension for librados ( http://ceph.newdream.net/wiki/Librados ).

The extension wraps the C API of librados into a extension, where almost all the native methods are implemented.

** LIMITATIONS **
The extension should work on both 32 and 64-bit systems, but due to PHP's engine it might now work well with very large objects.

Also, the selfmanaged snapshots are not implemented in the extension since their usage is pretty rare.

** METHODS / FUNCTIONS **
For a full overview of the available functions, open a terminal and run:

$ php --re rados
