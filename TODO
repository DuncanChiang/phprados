1. Right now phprados is "semi-OOP", where a High Level API might be desired to make things even easier in PHP
2. To access RADOS objects easily we want a stream wrapper so we can access objects via: file_get_contents("rados://poolname/objname");
3. The selfmanaged snapshots are not implemented yet, should be done in the future
4. Create a application on top of phprados to show it's capabilities
