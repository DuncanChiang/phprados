1. Right now you only have the plain librados functions. My goal is to have a OOP interface in PHP which makes using RADOS easier
2. To access RADOS objects easily we want a stream wrapper so we can access objects via: file_get_contents("rados://poolname/objname");
3. Create a application on top of phprados to show it's capabilities
4. A session handler which saves PHP sessions in RADOS
